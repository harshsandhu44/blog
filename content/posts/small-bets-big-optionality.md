# Optionality is a competitive advantage

Most bad decisions come from committing too hard, too early.

I prefer small, reversible bets that unlock better decisions later.

## My filter

1. Is this reversible?
2. What does this unlock?
3. What is the smallest version worth testing?

Optionality buys clarity.
