# Build where people can see it

I ship faster when I am clear about constraints and visible about progress.

## The rule

Pick one customer problem, solve it end-to-end, and publish before polishing everything.

## Why it works

- Feedback arrives earlier.
- Scope stays honest.
- Momentum compounds.

Shipping publicly is less about marketing and more about accountability.
