# Ordered chaos

This blog is built on a strict system and still refuses to look predictable.

- Every surface uses semantic tokens.
- Every page uses reusable shadcn primitives.
- Every post starts as markdown.

## Why this matters

When the system is strong, we can be expressive without becoming inconsistent.

```ts
const rule = "playful layout, disciplined tokens";
console.log(rule);
```
